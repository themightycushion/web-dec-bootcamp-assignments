            <!-- <h2>Personal Statement</h2> -->
            <!-- <p>I am a driven individual. When I have an idea I will change everything around me to align with how I can make that
                idea a reality. That is why I have chosen to pursue web development. I have identified it as a key tool that will
                enable me to live the life I dream of.</p> -->

            <p>I was born in Carshalton, Surrey but never new the place. My family moved straight to North Devon where I was raised
                and is the place I call home. I love the countryside which is why I was attracted to the opportunity to study for my
                degree at Cornwall College in Newquay, in association with Plymouth University. Here I could live by the sea and
                surf the waters to my hearts content.</p>

            <p>After university I began a passion project, designing and printing t-shirts. This developed into a business idea
                which led me to my first encounter with html and css while trying to develop my very own website. This is the experience
                that first sparked my interest in web development.</p>

            <!-- <p>My aspirations for a career had never been a priority until most recently in January 2021 when I began my training to become a
                network engineer in the Brish Army. However, during the last week of the 1 year and 5 months training, I yielded to a
                discharge due to a recurring leg injury. Personally, I see this is an opportunity to use what I learned in my
                training to follow my interest in web development to an entirely new career.
            </p> -->

            <p>My relative experience includes self-learning via online resources such as w3schools and Sololearn. Previously, I was training to be a network
                engineer in the British Army during which time I completed modules of study on IP addressing and API's. Also, I am currently
                participating in a web development bootcamp with Bath Spa University which covers HTML, CSS, JS, and React.</p>
